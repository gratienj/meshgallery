Welcome to ExaMeshGallery's documentation!
========================================================

Welcome to the 3D Mesh Gallery for Exascale Simulation

This gallery presents a collection of 3D meshes. It aims at providing free meshes 
that can beused to design and validate tools to generate and manage meshes 
for high-fidelity simulations for exascale computational systems. 
Explore and visualize complex geometries that enable groundbreaking research 
and innovation across various scientific and engineering disciplines.
